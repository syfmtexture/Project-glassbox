# 💀 GLASSBOX // UFDR-PARSER

> **the phone is dead. we're just performing the autopsy.**

### // the problem

police seizures generate **UFDR (universal forensic data recovery)** files—massive, chaotic data dumps that are essentially "digital noise." for most investigators, navigating these files is a technical nightmare. it’s slow, it’s messy, and critical evidence gets buried under thousands of lines of junk metadata.

### // the solution

**glassbox** is a high-speed forensic engine designed to strip away the "mess" and lay the device's soul bare. it transforms unreadable dumps into a structured, searchable, and visual timeline of human activity.

* **clinical extraction:** strips text logs, geodata, and app footprints from the ufdr mess.
* **zero-friction ui:** designed for investigators, not just tech nerds.
* **visual mapping:** turns raw coordinates into actual movement patterns.
* **dark-mode native:** because nobody wants to look at white screens at 3 am in a lab.

### // status

`[initialization stage]`
currently mapping the protocol for deep-parsing and automated connection-finding.
